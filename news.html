          Cheddar 0.1-625 was released today and is available on CRAN.

        <p>
          This release introduces an enhancement to the TrophicChains function. 
          The number of possible trophic chains within a food web rapidly 
          increases with the number of nodes and links. The worst-case scenario 
          is that every consumer eats every other node in the network. In this
          case, the of the number chains increases factorially with the 
          number of nodes and, even for food webs with relatively few nodes, 
          the number of trophic chains becomes too large to compute within 
          practical time and within available memory. The 'Large numbers of 
          trophic chains' section of the 'Community' vignette explains this in 
          more detail. Starting with this release of cheddar, the TrophicChains 
          function will raise an error if the number of chains reaches a 
          configurable safety limit.

          Cheddar 0.1-624 was released today and is available on CRAN.

        <p>
          This releases makes it possible to build cheddar using modern C++ 
          compilers. See the 
          <a href="https://github.com/quicklizard99/cheddar/blob/master/release_history.md#cheddar-release-history">release history</a>

          Cheddar 0.1-623 was released today and is available on CRAN.

          This release adds functions to that compute the quantitative web stats 
          defined by 
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2394:QDOFWM]2.0.CO;2">
            Bersier et al (2002) Ecology
          </a> - descriptors that are based upon information-theory and that 
          consider the strength of trophic interactions. 
          The NodeQuantitativeDescriptors and QuantitativeDescriptors 
          functions compute tables of node-level and community-level 
          quantitative descriptors respectively, as presented in Bersier et al 
          Tables 1 and 2.

          These release also introduces the NvMTriTrophicTable function, which 
          builds upon existing functions within cheddar, and provides a 
          convenient way to compute the set of statistics presented in Table 1
           of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0910582106">

        <p>
          The RemoveNode function has been enhanced in this release - it now 
          offers a range of methods for how species' removals are propagated 
          through the food web.

          Cheddar 0.1-620 was released today. See the <a href="https://github.com/quicklizard99/cheddar/blob/master/release_history.md#cheddar-release-history">release history</a> for details.

        <p>
          This release is not substantial enough to warrant submission to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>. Unfortunately, I have just discovered that github <a href="https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads">no longer host files for download</a> so I am unable to make this release available at the moment. I will look for alternative ways to make non-CRAN releases available.
        </p>

          If you would like 0.1-620 please contact me (lawrence.hudson08 (at) imperial.ac.uk).
