        <h2>Help me get my data into Cheddar!</h2>

        <p>
          Researchers typically use their own bespoke data formats. This 
          means that there are probably as many data formats as there are 
          researchers! It is therefore extremely hard to write a generic 
          'import my data into Cheddar' function.
        </p>

        <p>
          Help is at hand! If you have community data that you would like to 
          import into Cheddar, please contact me (lawrence.hudson08 (at) 
          imperial.ac.uk) - I will either provide example data-import R code 
          for you to modify or will write the required R code for you.
