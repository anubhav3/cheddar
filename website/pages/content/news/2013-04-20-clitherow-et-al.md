The authors examined patterns in species-poor communities of glacier-fed 
rivers. They used Cheddar to compute the suite of tritrophic food-web 
statistics, which combine the set of trophic links with species' body masses 
and numerical abundances. Their analysis revealed that any disturbances to a 
single taxon could propagate throughout the community food-web.
