Slug: Cheddar 0.1-623 released.
Author: Lawrence Hudson

Cheddar 0.1-623 was released today and is available on CRAN.

This release adds functions to that compute the quantitative web stats defined by 
[Bersier et al (2002)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2394:QDOFWM]2.0.CO;2)
 - descriptors that are based upon information-theory and that consider the 
 strength of trophic interactions. The `NodeQuantitativeDescriptors` and 
`QuantitativeDescriptors` functions compute tables of node-level and 
community-level quantitative descriptors respectively, as presented in Bersier 
et al Tables 1 and 2.

This release also introduces the `NvMTriTrophicTable` function, which builds 
upon existing functions within cheddar, and provides a convenient way to 
compute the set of statistics presented in Table 1 of
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0910582106](Cohen et al (2009))

The `RemoveNode` function has been enhanced in this release - it now offers a 
range of methods for how species' removals are propagated through the food web.
