The authors imposed different flow treatments on fresh-water mesocosms 
containing complex trophic communities. Cheddar was used to produce plots of 
the food-web data. Communities subjected to drought treaments had fewer species 
and fewer trophic interactions, leading to the partial collapse of the food web.
