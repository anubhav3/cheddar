Slug: Cheddar 0.1-625 released.
Author: Lawrence Hudson

Cheddar 0.1-625 was released today and is available on CRAN.

This release introduces an enhancement to the `TrophicChains` function. 
The number of possible trophic chains within a food web rapidly 
increases with the number of nodes and links. The worst-case scenario 
is that every consumer eats every other node in the network. In this
case, the of the number chains increases factorially with the 
number of nodes and, even for food webs with relatively few nodes, 
the number of trophic chains becomes too large to compute within 
practical time and within available memory. The _Large numbers of 
trophic chains_ section of the _Community_ vignette explains this in 
more detail. Starting with this release of cheddar, the `TrophicChains` 
function will raise an error if the number of chains reaches a 
configurable safety limit.
