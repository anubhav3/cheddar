We confronted a widely used model of community dynamics with empirical data 
from a lake community. Cheddar was used to examine changes in community 
properties, showing that any important empirical patterns were reproducible 
as outcomes of dynamics, and were not reproducible when parameters did not 
follow physiological allometries.
