The authors conducted a long-running field experiment to examine changes in 
the structure of stream communities that were subject to drought treatments. 
Cheddar was used to quantify changes in community structure. Drought caused 
the loss of many taxa and trophic links, resulting in changes in many network 
properties. Larger taxa and those that were rare for their size where most 
affected.

size structure in a field experiment.
