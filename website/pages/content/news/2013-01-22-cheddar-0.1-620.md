Slug: Cheddar 0.1-620 released.
Author: Lawrence Hudson

Cheddar 0.1-620 was released today. See the 
[release history](https://github.com/quicklizard99/cheddar/blob/master/release_history.md#cheddar-release-history) 
for details.

This release is not substantial enough to warrant submission to 
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Unfortunately, I have just discovered that 
github [no longer host files for download](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads) 
so I am unable to make this release available at the moment. I will look for 
alternative ways to make non-CRAN releases available.

If you would like 0.1-620 please contact me (lawrence.hudson08 (at) imperial.ac.uk).
